      <description>For those not familiar, the demoscene is a computer art subculture whose main focus is on producing self-contained audiovisual presentations for people to flex their programming, graphical or musical ability.
It started sometime in the early 1980s and remained quite popular up until the early 2000s. Its&amp;rsquo; popularity has fallen off somewhat in recent years, but it still continues today, with demos being released mostly at organised competitive events such as Evoke, a demoparty which is held annually in Cologne.</description>

      <p>Software development can be frustratingly difficult at times, but I suspect not in ways that one not involved in the process would expect.
This assumption of mine is based on how I view other subjects which I have some interest in, but am a complete novice or worse.</p>
<p>With drawing the thing most on my mind is simply trying to get my hand to produce the lines that I want.
Even when trying to produce a single line it never looks exactly as I want. Knowing all the right rules such as perspective, composition line weight and proportions don&rsquo;t matter at all if you can&rsquo;t simply get your hands to draw the damn line right.</p>
<p>When learning to play a musical instrument, the difficultly at first is getting your body to perform the right actions at the right time. Getting your fingers into the right shape to play a chord.</p>
<p>When learning programming, the initial were significant&hellip;

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I am well aware that this post will likely identify me in one of two possible ways. Either it will make me seem crazy, potentially suffering some sort of mental disorder, or it will ring true with everyone and be dismissed as a mundane observation and personality traits that everyone shares. Nothing noteworthy, just an tedious soliloquy, squeezed out and left to fester like all low effort posts on the internet. A cry for attention perhaps? Probably trying to push some personal agenda. Oh god, he doesn&rsquo;t have some new mobile app idea does he?!</p>
<p>But this post will be different from all the rest. It will be <em>my</em> drawn-out tedious shit. Complete with melodramatic flowery prose and excessive use of metaphors. My main purpose for this post though is to hopefully make it crystal clear that I can&rsquo;t be trusted. Any advice I may give or virtues I extol; they&rsquo;re manifestations of my own dilusionment. If at any point you consider my thoughts well-informed, trustworthy or confident, you are wrong. In future, whenever someone points out how wrong I am on some topic, I will direct them to this post and let them know that their observations are uninspired. I literally said this ages ago!</p>
<p>I suspect that others feel similar, but how does that help me? So I am going to vomit it all here, in the hopes that it frees me just a little from this endless drudgery.</p>
<p>While my words may be overly dramatic I would consider my mental state generally &ldquo;fine&rdquo; and &ldquo;sane&rdquo; most of the time. Although that leads me to wonder; would a person sane person ever referrer to themselves as mostly <em>sane</em>? Is the observation of this uncertainty in my head a sign of normality?</p>
<p>Honestly, I have no idea. But as of 2020 I will have been trapped in my own thoughts for 40 years, so I think it is about time that I share my insanity a little more with the wider world. If for no other reason than as a cathartic release of sorts.</p>
<h2 id="the-diagnosis">The diagnosis</h2>
<p>I have self-diagnosed severe social anxiety issues, and it leads me to distance myself from most social situations these days. I am constantly referred to as the <em>quiet one</em> by almost everyone I meet, and have been for almost as long as I can remember. Yet what I lack in vocal prowess I make up for in constant internal conflict. My thoughts are constantly at odds. A endless argument with no conclusion. I think my social issues are further exacerbated by a weird heredetary trait which causes some fairly noticable tremors in my hands when under the effects of adrenaline. Participating in an office rubix cube solving competition was in hind-sight NOT a good idea.</p>
<p>I have been constantly told throughout my life that &ldquo;putting myself out there&rdquo; and that &ldquo;everyone feels nervous in social situations&rdquo; and it is &ldquo;just something you need to get used to&rdquo;. I actually forced myself into a lot of these situations throughout my 20s and 30s. There was a significant amount of alchol involved in these experiments obviously, but I am very thankful that phase is now over. I am 40 now and, I realise that people don&rsquo;t know what the fuck they&rsquo;re talking about. Doubt if you will, but I am actually happier in my decision to abandon <em>fitting in</em>. I have found some kind of peace just being happy with what I am capable of, and stop trying to fit in for the sake of others.</p>
<p>I couch every almost every opinion and thought in qualifiers, so as to not unduly offend. Even in situations where I think my opinion is actually a cold-hard fact, I will word it in such a way as to appear unsure of myself. I can&rsquo;t be blamed if I told you I wasn&rsquo;t really sure in the first place, right? It also helps to keep the focus off myself. If I say &ldquo;I heard about X somewhere&rdquo;, or &ldquo;have you heard about X, I think I was it mentioned on <em>Y</em> a little while ago&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have a really bad memory, but I think it <em>might</em> be X&rdquo;. Obviously using language like this means my input is often dismissed, and rightly so.</p>
<p>There have been times where I have consciously tried to be more assertive in my statements. But then the focus is on me. I can feel it burning into me. And In that moment I can&rsquo;t help but drop to the floor and writhe. Suffocating the flames and retreating to where I can&rsquo;t be seen or held accountable for my words.</p>

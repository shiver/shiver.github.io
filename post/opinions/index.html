    <div class="content">
      <p>As a software developer who has been in or around the industry in one way or another for
just short of twenty years now, I find the content on the wider internet landscape more
and more difficult to digest. This is not a comment on the quality of the writing, the
intrusive nature of modern day advertising, or even the click-bait articles that are
overt in their inaccuracies and increasingly pervasive. Nor is this about the vitriolic
endless back-and-forth between supporters for opposing ideologies, be they political
or otherwise.</p>

<p>This is about opinions.</p>

<p>Opinions are not in and of themselves a bad thing, quite the opposite. They are the basis
of conversation, a kicking off point, the hypothesis, the precursor to the real work to come.
If we didn&rsquo;t have opinions to push at the barriers we would be forever mired in past assumptions
and certainties.</p>

<p>Opinions, backed by extensive experience are even more desirable.</p>

<p>Our civilisation survived on little else for thousands of years. Cautionary tales of the past,
molded into tradition, and passed between generations; often times the sole forms of education.
Wisdom and past experiences have always been held in high regard, and it is perhaps why we so
often see the archetypical <em>wise old king</em> in so many of these stories. Neither dictator nor tyrant,
but an individual of experience who is prepared to make difficult decisions or provide direction
for the betterment of both themselves and others.</p>

<p>This was not only a reasonable system to adopt, but entirely necessary. Without the
experience of the past, we are inextricably compelled to repeat the same mistakes, sometimes
with disastrous consequences. Having someone who has seeped themselves in a subject for
decades, and who can provide their insight and experience, can be an unmatched source of
information. There is almost no substitute.</p>

<p>Except, humans are not infallible.</p>

<p>They are shrouded in their upbringing, swayed by their education and indoctrinated by
the authority figures in their lives. This is further exacerbated by how much of
themselves they have invested into the path they have taken. It is a hard thing to hear,
that the effort you have expended and the truths you have uncovered are not as they
seem. Whether by intention or not we are tainted by our biases and it is a constant
battle to escape them and find the real truth that lies at the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>The scientific method has been our best answer to this problem, and with it, things have
changed quickly. Especially when compared to the sum of our existence. It has worked so
well precisely because it cares not for personal bias and preference. The truth will
rise to the surface, whether the outcome is desirable or not.</p>

<p>And yet, a large contingent of software developers behave rather curiously. It appears they are
intent on forsaking the progress that has been made and abandoning the lessons we have learned.</p>

<p>Past experience seems more likely to be maligned than admired. This is due in part to the use of
perceived <em>inferior</em> tools such as languages, libraries or frameworks, but also for the
structure of the code, or even the methodologies used (or lack there of). Anything that
doesn&rsquo;t meld with modern ideals is either completely ignored, or frequently simply ridiculed.</p>

<p>Instead engineers at places like Google, Facebook and Uber are held in the highest regard even though
it is known that these companies tend to favour recent graduates as employees. Which is not to say
that these people are not intelligent, but they clearly don&rsquo;t have the experience of seasoned
veterans. More importantly though, solutions for a company at these scales clearly aren&rsquo;t suitable
for the overwhelming majority of businesses.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.&rdquo; - Richard Feynman</em></p>

<p>This is further exacerbated by the propensity for a large contingent of developers to talk in
hyperbole and absolutes. &ldquo;This is terrible&rdquo;. &ldquo;Why would anyone use this?&rdquo;. &ldquo;You should use <em>X</em>
instead, it is way better than <em>Y</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just do <em>Z</em>?&ldquo;. &ldquo;Out of date&rdquo;, &ldquo;legacy&rdquo;,
&ldquo;spaghetti code&rdquo;, &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Alternatives are provided in the form of <em>feelings</em> and anecdotal evidence. If instead they were
advocating systems and methods proven to be superior by rigorous study, this would clearly be the
right thing to do. Instead, unfounded assertions are being thrown around for what appears to be simply
kudos and <em>internet points</em>.</p>

<p>This is not only my observation with online communities where the vitriol is frequent, but
in private offices and at conferences. Frequently these are even the subject of the talks themselves.</p>

<p>As someone who is still actively trying to learn and improve, this is especially frustrating.
The skill seems to not be in being able to parse potentially complex information, but in knowing
what information to ignore instead. Considering the sheer enormity of the content on the internet,
this is becoming nearly impossible.</p>

<p>I have genuine concern for people who are new to the field and may not be able to navigate this
quite as easily. Potentially leading them down paths that are clearly of no benefit to them. In fact
I think a large number of people have already been led astray in a significant manner, but
I won&rsquo;t go into that here.</p>

<p>I understand that software development as a whole is a new field and we&rsquo;re still trying to find our
way in it all. But we need to be better in how information is shared and promises are made if we&rsquo;re
to avoid drowning ourselves in our own hubris.</p>

<p>When you have an opinion, state as much. Do not word it in a manner that could be misconstrued by
people unfamiliar with the fields&rsquo; idiosyncrasies as fact. Do not repeat unfounded opinions you read
in some random blog, reddit comment or twitter post. If you want to be taken seriously, either
back your assertions with statistically significant proof or at least publish your findings so that
they can be used by someone else in a better position to confirm or deny your hypothesis.</p>

<p>Maybe it is true that everyone needs to be able to make their own mistakes to be able to fully
grasp why the choice was bad. But I am concerned that in the current climate that we aren&rsquo;t even
aware that we are making bad choices anymore.</p>

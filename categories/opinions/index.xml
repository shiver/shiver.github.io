      <description>As a software developer who has been in or around the industry in one way or another for over twenty years now, I find the content on the wider internet landscape more and more difficult to digest. This is not a comment on the quality of the writing, the intrusive nature of modern day advertising, or even the click-bait articles that are overt in their inaccuracies and increasingly pervasive. Nor is this about the vitriolic endless back-and-forth between supporters for opposing ideologies, be they political or otherwise.</description>

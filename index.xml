      <description>For those not familiar, the demoscene is a computer art subculture whose main focus is on producing self-contained audiovisual presentations for people to flex their programming, graphical or musical ability.
It started sometime in the early 1980s and remained quite popular up until the early 2000s. Its&amp;rsquo; popularity has fallen off somewhat in recent years, but it still continues today, with demos being released mostly at organised competitive events such as Evoke, a demoparty which is held annually in Cologne.</description>

      <description>As a software developer who has been in or around the industry in one way or another for over twenty years now, I find the content on the wider internet landscape more and more difficult to digest. This is not a comment on the quality of the writing, the intrusive nature of modern day advertising, or even the click-bait articles that are overt in their inaccuracies and increasingly pervasive. Nor is this about the vitriolic endless back-and-forth between supporters for opposing ideologies, be they political or otherwise.</description>
